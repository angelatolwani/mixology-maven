# Phase 1 Project

Using the public drinks API https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php, user will be able to search for a drink and find its ingredients and recipes.

3 Event Listener Core Deliverables:
1. "Submit" to search for a drink --> displays a list of drinks related to the string in the search tool
2. "Mouse over" --> displays an image of the drink from the displayed list of drinks
2. "Click" to select the drink of choice --> displays the drink image, recipe, and instructions for making the drink

Stretch goals:
1. Allow the user to enter the number of servings they would like to make, and update the recipe accordingly
2. Allow the user to "favorite" drink recipes
